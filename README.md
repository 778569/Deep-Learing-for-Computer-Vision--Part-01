## Discussed topics 
1.	Computer Vision
2.	What is Convolution?
3.	Complex images
4.	CNN – Key Idea
5.	Anatomy of CNN
6.	What Happen in CNN
7.	Activation Function
8.	Pooling
9.	Fully Connected Layers

## Lab - Test 01 (1d_convolution)
Filter signal using 1D convolution – Basic Signal , plot using matplotlib library #matplotlib.pyplot.stem, use Convolution Filter –  Use the convolution operation. and chnage the input array and cheack again how to filter the signal.
